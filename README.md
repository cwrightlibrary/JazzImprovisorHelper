# 🎷 Jazz Improvisor Helper

_A desktop tool for jazz musicians to practice improvisation with randomly generated ii-V-I chord progressions, motifs, and MIDI playback._

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Jazz Improvisor Helper** is a Java Swing desktop application designed to help musicians, students, and improvisers sharpen their jazz chops by generating:

- Random ii-V-I progressions in any key
- Motifs and melodic fragments in jazz scales/modes
- MIDI playback for both chords and melodies
- A way to save and revisit your favorite sequences

Whether you're jamming, studying jazz theory, or just need fresh ideas, this tool provides structured randomness to inspire improvisation.

## 🧠 Motif Generation Algorithm

Motifs are generated by walking through user-selected scales using various methods:

* **Random Walk:** Small random jumps within the scale
* **Directional:** Ascending or descending runs
* **Interval Patterning:** Apply patterns like `+3, -2, +4`

Scales supported:

* Major (Ionian), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian

Rhythmic variation and swing feel can be optionally enabled.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

* Validate chord construction and motif generation
* Ensure MIDI timing and UI responsiveness
* Verify favorites saving/loading

---

## 💡 Ideas for Future Enhancements

* Display on-screen keyboard or fretboard
* Visual motif rendering (staff or piano roll)
* Built-in jazz theory tooltips
* Style presets (bebop, bluesy, modal, etc.)
* Dark mode
